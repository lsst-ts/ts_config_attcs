# Ticket used to create this file: DM-30949
# Date created: 2021-07-07
# Description: DM-30949 Support AT observing run
#   Data taken on the summit still pending validation.
#   New M1 pressure LUT with data taken on 20210216
#   New Hexapod LUT. This LUT was generated after the top end spider was
#   "manually" tightened by Craig and Bruno. Due to the reduced number of
#   available data taken after the tightening procedure, we matched data taken
#   before and after. The overall behavior of the LUT is pretty similar in both
#   cases, but offset with respect to the original procedure. A notebook with
#   this procedure is available in the ts_analysis_notebooks repository in
#   notebooks/auxtel/athexapod/lut/20210707/.
#   The main difference between the hexapod LUT generated here and the one in
#   hex_m1_hex_20210706 is that we added the data taken on the night before to
#   compute the LUT.
